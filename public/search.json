[{"categories":["Engineering"],"content":"I recently found myself needing to enforce color values in a hex code format after discovering a mix of hex codes and CSS color names in my data. The easiest way to do this was to build a static map. My application is built with PHP so I needed to get the full list of CSS color names as listed on the W3’s website into an associative PHP array. This was my journey. Start with the W3’s list of colors and using Chrome’s inspector, copy the HTML table. Animated GIF showing an HTML table being copied with Chrome’s inspector tools. Then, using an online HTML table-to-CSV converter, paste the table’s HTML code and download a formatted CSV. You could use a table-to-JSON converter, but CSVs are easier to manipulate and customize via something like Excel or Numbers. For me, I wanted to delete the first two columns as they are for HTML display purposes and hold no real data or value for my needs. colors.csv Once the CSV was tidied up, it was on to a CSV-to-JSON converter. Here, I chose the “hash” instead of the “array” option as I wanted a keyed/hashed list which would make it easier to target specific colors. colors.json Last but not least, it was on to another free online too - a JSON-to-PHP array converter. True, PHP can easily parse a JSON file into an associative array, but if it’s configuration and something likely not to change ever, it’s better to just use a native array and put it in your source code. colors.php Now I can do this: $hex = $colors['hex']['aquamarine']; // or $rgb = $colors['rgb']['aquamarine']; That’s it. It was a short walk with multiple jumps. Were there better ways to get here? Possibly, but what matters is that I got there and I’m sharing the files here in case anyone (ie: future me) finds themselves needing to translate CSS color names into hex codes or an RGB value.

For incoming calls, this can easily be accomplished by putting a \u003cSay\u003e or \u003cPlay\u003e verb in your TwiML before dialing the intended application or party. But for outgoing calls, how do you ensure a message or recording is played to someone as soon as they answer the call? You can send TwiML instructions to a recipient that will be run before they’re connected to the main call. This can be done through the url attribute of the \u003cNumber\u003e verb. By setting the url attribute, we can specify a URL that will return a TwiML response to be run on the called party’s end. This TwiML will run after they answer, but before the parties are connected. “Running TwiML Before Parties Are Connected” - twilio.com \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e \u003cResponse\u003e \u003cDial\u003e \u003cNumber url=\"http://example.com/agent_screen_call\"\u003e415-123-4567\u003c/Number\u003e \u003c/Dial\u003e \u003c/Response\u003e In the example above, before the 415-123-4567 number being connected to the parent call, the url will be requested by Twilio and the response’s TwiML will be executed.

I recently watched an interview with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen from 2018 where Paul discusses how he got the role of Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the interview, he says he had a meeting with a producer that told him he was done in Hollywood, and immediately following that meeting he [Bettany] received a phone call from Joss Whedon offering him the part of Vision. This story reminded me of the time that I was told I would “never work in this town again”. Years ago, while living and working in Greenville, South Carolina, I was unhappy with my job and I was trying to break out of it. I was looking for another position in local marketing agencies as a web developer. At the time, I had zero connections to the local community and did all of my job searching with Google: “php developer greenville sc”. Despite the no networking abilities, no connections, and poor job search skills, I found a local shop that was more web development than marketing, and they were hiring. Their website’s job description included a link to an online application with the usual resume upload and personal info, but it also included a questionnaire wanting more specifics on experience, programming style, and various bits and bobs. So, I started filling out the application. That’s when I received a phone call. A local recruiter, who shall not be named, from a local recruiting agency, that too will remain nameless, phoned me up. They had seen my profile on LinkedIn and had an opportunity for me. They told me all about the company and the position and it all sounded great. I was excited about the possibility of interviewing there, so the recruiter agreed to send them my information. At the end of the call, he revealed the name of the company he was hiring for. It was the same company I had tracked down myself and was in the middle of applying for. After the phone call, I went back to my browser and looked at my half completed application. The direct application was asking many more questions than the recruiter asked me, so in my inexperienced and young mind, I thought “hey, I’ll just finish filling this out and when they get my resume from the recruiter, they’ll have a little extra info on me for the interview”. I didn’t see anything wrong with my thinking. I thought it would help my chances. I was wrong. The next day I got a call from the recruiter. Excited and thinking it was to schedule an interview, I answered the phone. I was immediately berated with accusations of “double submittal” and trying to “screw” the recruiter. I was in shock. I casually explained that I had already been in the middle of an application and decided to finish it as the company was asking more specific questions than the recruiter did. I also explained that since the recruiter was sending my info over, I didn’t see how it was a “double submittal”. The recruiter wasn’t having any of it, and then he hit me with “I’ll make sure you never work in this town again”. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I was nervous and scared. Could this person really prevent me from getting another job in my city? Logically I knew he couldn’t, but emotions are quicker to the brain than logic. Years later I would become friends with the owners of the company that I had attempted to interview with and they remembered the incident. They told me the same recruiter threatened to blackball their company if they hired me. Needless to say, I did not get the interview. A few months after the incident, I received a cold call from a local business owner about a different opportunity in town that was a bigger step up than the one I had attempted to get earlier. I took the job which eventually led to other possibilities and eventually to where I am now, a full-time remote Software Engineer working for an international company.

Luckily, we had a backup from the night before and that table was low traffic. What happened was that I thought I was on the staging server and I was doing some testing and needed to clear out the existing data. I was not on staging. I was on production. I learned a valuable lesson and I was determined never to make the same mistake again. Enter, color coded SSH sessions: I developed color schemes for different environments that would easily stand out and alert me of where I was. For my local environment, I use a black background with green text. This is part Matrix and part me not having a computer growing up in the 90s and missing out on the nostalgia of pre-GUI terminals. On staging, I use a blue/violet mix that isn’t jarring to the eye or mind but still catches my attention and makes me aware of the environment. Lastly, for production-based servers I use a red background which definitely stands for “ALERT, whatever you do will have consequences!” To color code the environments I use separate profiles within iTerm. Once I customized the profiles to my liking, I needed a way to easily and dynamically switch between them. I did some googling and came across a bash function on StackOverflow called it2prof. Essentially this function is a shortcut to an iTerm command to switch profiles but the function is a lot cleaner to use: it2prof staging. That command will then switch the current iTerm window’s profile to the profile and color scheme of my “staging” profile. To connect to an environment, I use shortcuts and aliases to run my commands at once, for instance: ssh staging aliases to it2prof staging \u0026\u0026 ssh steven@stage01 which will change the terminal profile and then ssh into my staging server. This level of safe guarding will likely do for most people, however, I am paranoid and now I have multiple production environments to deal with. For instance, at work, we use a control box to do our releases, but we also have individual production servers that you can log into. So I wanted an extra notification of where I was to pop up. Text to ASCII! I wanted a proper warning message to pop up and be as in my face as possible to let me know which boxes I was on. I used this tool to convert my text to ASCII art which I then saved to text files either on my local machine or the remote server. If you have your own user on a server you could do like what I did on the staging environment and update the .bashrc file to output the contents of a file when your Bash profile is loaded (upon log in). To do this, update your .bashrc file with a line like cat env_msg.txt where “env_msg.txt” is the text file containing your ASCII art. My production servers use different user permissions so instead, I stored those warning files locally and just updated my aliases. For work, I created a fub (short for Follow Up Boss) function that helps me do various things, one of them being ssh-ing into a server. I simply updated each SSH command with a call to cat my text file like so: it2prof control \u0026\u0026 cat /Users/steven/production-warning.txt \u0026\u0026 ssh production01. Now all I have to type into my terminal is fub ssh prod01 and my terminal profile turns red, I get the boldface production warning, and I’m ssh’d into the proper machine. Now, I’m always aware of what machine I’m working on and I haven’t made the same mistake again as I did all those years ago. Do what you need to to guard/help yourself. Remember, stay safe out there.

It’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s ugly, it’s messy, it’s… old. But we shouldn’t have a negative outlook on legacy or old code. It’s there for a reason, we just need to appreciate that reason. When starting a new job and getting your first look at the legacy codebase, it’s easy to be frightened or disgusted. If the code has been around for a long time (in Internet years), it probably doesn’t meet modern style guides or follow modern practices. We can easily look at this code and deem it inferior to the code that is being written presently. To do so, though, is to disrespect the developers and the decisions that came before us. \" Legacy code is established\" We need to reframe our minds and stop hating and disrespecting legacy code and instead appreciate it for what it is: legacy code is established. The lines you’re judging are there for a reason; they have lasted the test of time; they have served a purpose. Most importantly of all, they have given you a job. Without those “old” or “ugly” lines of code, you would not have the job that you’re using now to put down that very code. Programmers don’t set out with the intention of writing bad or ugly code. They don’t sit down and think of the most convoluted solution they can write. Code becomes complex, intertwined, and unpleasant over time. Each feature begins with a single typed character and builds from there. As the business grows and its needs change, so does the code. A friend of mine once said that “bad” code is the product of not enough time, poorly defined requirements, or inexperience, not necessarily a bad programmer. Business moves fast and as developers, we’re constantly working against the clock to release features to draw in customers and make more money. It’s for these reasons that we must change how we think about and see legacy code - it is not something to be looked down upon, it is a legacy that was passed down to us that we must now carry forward for the next generation of programmers. When we are handed a legacy codebase, it becomes ours to shepherd forward. Build and improve upon the legacy, but overall, respect it.

The official documentation states that the function “only returns the (possibly transformed) subjects where there was a match” meaning if no elements match the given pattern, an empty array is returned (when dealing with an array of course). For example, take an array of multiple type of entity types and their IDs: $ids = [123, 'team:4', 52, 'pond:16', 'team:12', 6]; In the array above, we have users (integer IDs), teams (prefixed by “team:”) and a “pond” entity prefixed by “pond:”. If we want to process teams and ponds we could use a traditional loop checking for prefixes and parsing out the integer IDs like so: $teamIds = []; $pondIds = []; foreach ($ids as $id) { if (strpos($id, 'team') !== false) { $teamIds[] = (int) preg_replace('/\\D/', '', $id); } elseif (strpos($id, 'pond') !== false) { $pondIds[] = (int) preg_replace('/\\D/', '', $id); } } Or, we could clean that up with a single line per entity type with preg_filter: $teamIds = array_values(array_map('intval', preg_filter('/team\\:/', '', $ids))); $pondIds = array_values(array_map('intval', preg_filter('/pond\\:/', '', $ids))); In the code above, preg_filter will look for array items matching the given prefix pattern and return the values after that pattern (ie: the IDs). This not only searches our array, but it also strips the entity prefix for us in a single function call. Combined with the intval map loop, the code cleans up nicely. The new arrays are reset with the array_values function because preg_filter will return an array of matches and preserve the original indexes. This can cause an issue sometimes, especially when combined with PDO parameters so it’s best to just reset it and forget it.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” - Martin Fowler I have a friend who once told me that it’s our jobs to write code that can be maintained. When you open up someone else’s code, or even your own from a while back, the clock immediately starts ticking. The more time you have to think about what code is doing or what variable p stands for, the more time you’re wasting and the more money your employer is spending. Our jobs as engineers is to solve problems quickly, efficiently, and proficiently. Code is meant to be proficient yes, but so are we at our jobs. It’s a lot simpler to declare explicit variables and have descriptive method names, than to use arbitrary names or abbreviations, or to solely rely on annotations to explain your intension. p.first isn’t expressive, whereas person.first_name is immediately readable and understandable. There’s a fun game to play called Code Golf. The point of the game is to refactor code making it shorter and smaller until you reach the least amount of characters possible to still produce the same outcome as before. While fun to play, it also demonstrates that there’s a certain point that you reach where you start to sacrifice readability for performance while increasing cognitive load. Being mindful of the amount of cognitive load your code adds to yourself or a colleague is one of the most important aspects of your job. There’s a great quote that says: “Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.” While not the most cheerful saying, it’s always good to be mindful of how your code will read to the next person, or to you in 6 months when you’ve moved on to another project.

I’ll do another post in the future discussing those more, but that’s not the focus of this post. HubSpot has a secret, and I’ve found it out. Ok, so it’s not the coolest secret in the world. It’s not like I’ve found a backdoor into their mainframe or detected a glitch in the Matrix or anything, but I thought it was pretty cool. So I’d like to share with the world. I said I wasn’t going to mention the failings of the HubSpot API in depth in this post, and I’m not going to, but I should at least mention a few to serve as a prologue. The HubSpot API is fragmented. What do I mean by that? Everything has an endpoint. That’s not necessarily bad, but when dealing with rate limits it can become a hassle. Having to get a list of things, then get a list of things for those things can easily get out of hand and you can run into a 1+n or an n+1 problem. For the requirements of the project that I’m working on, I worry about the 10 requests/second limit. A single page load won’t hit 10, but if multiple loads for different customers takes place, we might run into that problem. This concern led me to google “hubspot graphql” in hopes that maybe, just maybe there’s a better option out there that I hadn’t found yet. There’s not. However, that did lead me to this article on Medium: Choosing GraphQL to build Drift’s messaging platform The author of that article states that he led the engineering team at HubSpot through their API rewrite. Before diving into the “lessons learned” and the confessions of what they did wrong, he starts out with this: At HubSpot, as soon as a front-end engineer would ask for another piece of data, especially one that required either calculation or aggregation, I would suggest they make one or more extra calls on the client. Unfortunately, they obliged. This snippet sets up my favorite part of the article: Many of our front-end engineers decided to tackle the problem head-on and began deploying lightweight node.js proxy services to combine multiple requests from our APIs into simpler responses containing exactly what they needed while reducing network latency. That got me thinking. I wanted to know what these guys had done. If they were dogfooding their subpar API, then maybe they had done something themselves to solve at least some of the problems that I was experiencing. So I fired up my test HubSpot account, opened the network tab in the Chrome Developer Tools, and proceeded to snoop the network requests being made on a contact’s profile. Most of the calls to the API were the same ones listed in the public docs, but there were a few in there that weren’t. Naturally I grabbed the Urls and threw them into Postman. Example URL: https://api.hubapi.com/email/v1/contacts/jdoe@example.com/subscriptions?hapikey=xxx-xx-xx-xxxxxx Response: This endpoint does not accept EXTERNAL hapikeys, and has no special allowances for this hapikey (xxx-xx-xx-xxxxxx). hapikey auth configuration for this endpoint: HapikeyAuthenticator{allows=INTERNAL} Drats! But this was still interesting. They were using the same API subdomain, but certain URIs were marked as internal only. Fascinating. I thought that was the end of that. I went about my business continuing work on on the task at hand - mucking about with API calls and transforming the responses for our needs. Then one day I notice something in the response object for a contact: { \"profile-url\": \"https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/{contact-id}/lists/public/contact/{a-super-long-obfuscated-string}/\" } Clicking that link (the real one, not the sample 😃 ) opens a public page showing most of the info for a contact that you’d see in the HubSpot app. “Is this truly public?” I thought to myself. So I opened it in an Incognito window and yup, same info. How was HubSpot doing this? Time to fire up the network tab again and go snooping! This time, the snooping paid off.

This gave me cause to reflect on the past two years and the successes they’ve brought and the lessons I’ve learned while starting and running a user group. Officially, UpstatePHP started in March 2014, however, it actually began 4 months earlier with an idea. I’ve heard the saying “if you don’t have a local user group, start one.” That’s easier said than done for me. I’m a self-diagnosed introvert. To my friends I seem outgoing, but that’s only when I’m really comfortable with the people around me. Throw me into a new situation, like a party where I don’t know anyone, a new job, or really anything that involves human/stranger interaction, and I’m as quiet as a mouse. Now, a good 4 months of straight hanging out with those people and becoming close to them, then I’m outgoing, loud, stupid, and maybe funny? So the idea of starting a user group myself scared the crap out of me because it meant I’d have to be front and center and constantly have strangers looking at me for direction. Ironically, being an introverted person and not enjoying meeting new people, I actually have a passion for community, for sharing. So ultimately, I started UpstatePHP. But how do you go from idea to execution? How do you take that seed and grow it into something prosperous and fruitful? I didn’t know, but was determined to figure it out. So after two years of running a successful user group, I’ve learned a few things, and I’d like to share them with the world. Anyone Can Do It Anyone absolutely can start a user group. I mean that. Prior to starting UpstatePHP, I had never even been to a user group meeting so I honestly had no idea what to do. Don’t let inexperience stand in your way. Look around at other user groups and see what they’re doing. I personally stole borrowed inspiration from SoFlophp. Meetup.com Pay the $10 or $15 for a meetup.com account. Starting out, I was too cheap to shell out $15/month for a meetup.com account and instead went the free route and created a simple Facebook group. This works well at first as it provides events, and a place for members to post information. We quickly outgrew Facebook and needed a website to have pages to display static information. Now I had 2 sites to manage instead of one. It’s not worth the hassle of rolling your own site to start with. Start with meetup.com and grow from there if you need to. Most likely, you won’t. You Can’t Do It Alone Helping Hands Running a user group is a lot of work. Networking, marketing, finding speakers and sponsors every month is a lot of work for one person. Starting out, this will most likely all fall on your shoulders, but watch out for anyone showing interest in volunteering and let them. Early on I was fortunate to find a great partner, Ryan McAllen, who was willing to find sponsors for me every month. This was a HUGE burden off of my shoulders, and I couldn’t do it without Ryan. If anyone is willing to help in anyway, let them. This is their group, not yours. Build a community of helping hands. Sponsors You need sponsors. You’ll need a place to meet for sure. Find someone to sponsor you and give you a space in their office to meet every month. Almost as importantly, try and find sponsors for food each month. If you’re asking people to give you their evening, feed them. It’ll go a long way. Be Consistent Consistency is key. You need to find a time and day that works, and stick to it. Shifting things around will confuse people and you may permanently lose members. Have you ever seen an awesome show (*cough* Alcatraz but it fails because the network (*cough* Fox) moves the day and time more than once? People need consistency and schedules. If I know my favorite show comes on every Monday at 8pm, I’ll make my schedule around that. If the day and time float, I’ll probably end up not watching it and miss out on something great.

They get angry when someone steals their parking space, when a baby won’t stop crying in a public setting, or when the quality of their latest Netflix binge is below Super HD.

The human body is capable of amazing things, under normal circumstances. But what about those who’s circumstances are a little less normal? Let me interject real quick. My wife is my hero. She’s a wonderfully strong spirited woman and she’s exceptionally brilliant. My wife had a rough start to life. She was adopted at 2 weeks old. She was an at risk SID baby and placed on a heart monitor for the first few months of her life. At just a few months old, her parents and doctors discovered she had actually been born blind. Miraculously, another few months after her blindness was discovered, she could see. Her sight wasn’t perfect, but it was something. She had heavy prescription glasses from an early age, and while some might see her sight as a setback in life, she had a relatively normal childhood. She ran, played basketball, and was driving a four wheeler by the time she could walk (she grew up in Iowa). She didn’t let her eyesight handicap her. She dealt with and adjusted for her “limitations”. What other choice did she have? Being born in the mid/late 80′s and growing up in the early 90′s, there weren’t a lot of options besides glasses. Optometrists told her that her prescription was too high for soft contacts and she’d have to wear hard ones if she wanted the option. Now, I can’t even stand a spec of dust or a slight breeze in my eye, I couldn’t imagine a hard piece of plastic sitting flush against my eyeball. But she did it. I’m not sure if it was her “limitations” in life that contributed to her stubbornness, or if she was just born that way (it’s one of my favorite things about her btw), but being the strong willed woman that she is, she stuck that hard plastic in her eye on a daily basis. Years later, technology would improve. Materials got thinner and lighter. No more of the bottle cap glasses of yesteryear. Goodbye to the hard contacts and hello to the soft comfortable contacts that the rest of the world is able to enjoy. With the advancements in technology, I asked the same question that I’m sure you’re asking right now. What about LASIK? The answer was the same as one she too often gave out when people would look too long at her eyes. She was born with Nystagmus. It’s a condition of involuntary eye movement. The movement isn’t as noticeable as she thinks, but it does make her self conscious and it is something that you can see after speaking with her for a few minutes. Since this condition and the movement is involuntary, it obviously means she can’t control it and therefore can’t keep her eyes still during the LASIK procedure. Despite the lack of corrective options available to my wife, she still enjoys life and her independence. Again, my wife is a very strong woman and very independent, but she does rely on others to travel. With her glasses, she’s legally blind. She is able to have a license (with a doctor’s note), and is able to legally drive during daylight hours. I’ve ridden with her, she’s a wonderful driver. Facing such limitations of sight though doesn’t give her the best confidence wh","date":"2014-03-05","objectID":"/2014/03/05/the-web-helped-me-see-through-my-wifes-eyes/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"The Web Helped Me See Through My Wife's Eyes","uri":"/2014/03/05/the-web-helped-me-see-through-my-wifes-eyes/"},{"categories":["Engineering"],"content":"It’s almost November and boy has 2013 been a rough year for PHP. From what I gather, it’s “hip” to hate PHP right now. With so many outsiders, and insiders, fighting and bashing the language and each other as if they were high school rivals, I’ve been rather surprised and elated to see the formation of the PHP FIG and the work they’ve done with the PSR standard. Having so many library and framework authors come together, agree upon a standard way of doing things in order to make their code interoperable, and then actually upgrading their code to meet said standard is an amazing feat that just a short while ago would have seemed impossible. Now is an exciting time for PHP. New features are being proposed, added, and implemented faster than any previous time in history. PHP drives the world’s largest website ( Facebook) and powers the world’s most popular content management system ( WordPress). With so much love for open source, social coding, and cooperation amongst the industry leaders and PHP community as a whole, why are we still fighting over what comes down to either: A) Personal preference, or B) The right tool for the right job. Shut up and build your shit! My first intro to PHP was through the framework CodeIgniter. It taught me so much about PHP as a language while making it easy to accomplish tasks beyond intro level ability. Granted, I did learn some bad habits by adhering so much to the syntax of the framework as opposed to vanilla PHP. Through the years my abilities have grown, my practices have become more industry standard, and I have branched out into other frameworks. I’ve even written a micro framework that I use in my job to work around the limitations of their internal system. One principle that drives me daily is to use the right tool for the right job. When I used to build websites from scratch, I had three CMSs that I would choose from ( Joomla!, WordPress, PyroCMS). Each one met a different set of criteria for each job, and I had a certain comfort level in each system as well. I no longer build websites, but with any new custom application I write, I start by evaluating the needs and requirements of the job. My framework of choice at the moment is Laravel but I still go with the classic CodeIgniter from time to time depending. These happen to be the frameworks that I am currently most comfortable with and allow me to do my job quickly and efficiently. I’m eager and willing to try other frameworks as well. I love new things. I love playing with new things even more. My rant here is inspired by a recent post I read ( Publish Your Failures; or, The Way Of All Frameworks), and the comment banter between the post’s author, Paul M. Jones, and the author of Laravel, Taylor Otwell. The post is a good read and I encourage you to check it out (if you haven’t already). I get frustrated reading the comments between Taylor and Paul because I see two wonderfully brilliant men going back and forth over something so simple as an opinion. That’s what these are, opinions. Really, that’s what their two (and any) frameworks are, they are opinions. Any framework is just an opinion of how something “should” or could be done. There is no right or wrong way to go about a problem. There are no right or wrong opinions, just our perception of what is “right” and what is “wrong” based upon our own personal opinions. I am not without my strong convictions and preferences/opinions. I will argue a syntax with my coworker until we’re blue in the face. In the end, if the code solves the problem and solves it well, who cares how you did it, what framework or library you used, or whether you used spaces or tabs? It doesn’t matter. Let’s all learn to appreciate each other for what each of us brings to the table. Let’s all encourage each other to grow and learn. What sets the software community apart from any other in the world is the openness and the fact that the amount of encouragement and positivity greatly outweighs the amount of disco","date":"2013-10-31","objectID":"/2013/10/31/dont-bind-yourself-to-a-framework-or-shut-up-and-build-your-shit/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"\"Don't Bind Yourself To A Framework\" or: Shut Up and Build Your Shit","uri":"/2013/10/31/dont-bind-yourself-to-a-framework-or-shut-up-and-build-your-shit/"},{"categories":["Engineering"],"content":"Update: I’ve neglected the project for many years and finally decided to release the domain name. The domain is no longer mine, but the code for the app can be found on GitHub. Regular Expressions, does anyone actually like them? I suck at them. If you’re like me at all, you struggle with them too. When I need to use regular expressions, I spend countless amounts of time on RegexPal trying to find just the right combination. That’s why I built Build RegEx. This week, I discovered VerbalExpressions. Oh my! Regex made simple! What could be better than this? A GUI!! Thanks to the suggestion of my buddy Mike Crittenden, I decided to make a simple GUI that uses the VerbalExpressions JavaScript library. Here you go world! Enjoy!
