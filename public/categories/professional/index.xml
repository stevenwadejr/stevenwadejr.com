      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that phrase in TV and movies, in fact, it&amp;rsquo;s become quite cliché in my opinion. I recently watched an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;interview with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 where Paul discusses how he got the role of Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the interview, he says he had a meeting with a producer that told him he was done in Hollywood, and immediately following that meeting he [Bettany] received a phone call from Joss Whedon offering him the part of Vision. This story reminded me of the time that I was told I would &amp;ldquo;never work in this town again&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
