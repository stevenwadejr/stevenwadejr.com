**Update:** I've neglected the project for many years and finally decided to release the domain name. The domain is no longer mine, but the code for the app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenwadejr/Build-Regex).

Regular Expressions, does anyone actually like them? I suck at them. If you’re like me at all, you struggle with them too. When I need to use regular expressions, I spend countless amounts of time on [RegexPal](http://regexpal.com/) trying to find just the right combination. That’s why I built Build RegEx.

This week, I discovered [VerbalExpressions](https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions). Oh my! Regex made simple! What could be better than this? A GUI!! Thanks to the suggestion of my buddy [Mike Crittenden](http://mikecr.it/), I decided to make a simple GUI that uses the VerbalExpressions JavaScript library. Here you go world! Enjoy!

Feedback welcome (comments and bugs).
